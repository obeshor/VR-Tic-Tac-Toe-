# VR-Tic-Tac-Toe-
In this project, you’ll play detective and put your optimization skills to use by speeding up a poorly optimized VR game. The game is Tic-Tac-Toe, played against a friendly AI Robot. While fun and attractive, the only problem is that the experience is completely unoptimized for mobile VR. Your task is to use what you’ve learned to optimize this project to run at 60 frames per second on your phone.
